He's got amazing talent but so down to earth and able to translate that into something meaningful for everyone.","Xpos","Vpos","This was my third year at this camp, but my very first having time with Scooter.  He was a coach for our band one session (Chick Keys) and was generally helpful; didn't get in our way. He had some great stories!

I also bought a used mandolin from Scott while at the camp (guitar is my main instrument) and I sat in on the mandolin class taught by Scooter on the very last day. It was GREAT. I was brand new to the instrument, and there were intermediate and advanced folks also in the same group, and I think we all got something out of it.

Scooter was also the coach for a small jam group on my very last day - mostly advanced folks (the Up Cane Creek folks invited Chick Keys to join them) and he just let us go forth and have fun, but he still contributed.","","","I had only passing interaction with Joan this year, and I missed that!","Xpos","Xpos","Keith is such a gifted instructor. He was coach for the Chick Keys for a couple of sessions and we all learned so much. He would have just a small tidbit to share for an individual on an instrument, then suggestions for how we operated as a group.  For example, he helped us figure out how to incorporate dynamics into our group playing. I play to schedule some individual lesson time with him (via Skype) over the next few months. Awesome!","Xpos","Xpos","I've been to at least 8 different camps with Gilbert and he was fabulous, as always. I joined the ""fill in licks"" session, and he showed everyone a neat ""move up the neck"" lick (chromatic) and did a great job a) showing us the lick on individual instruments then putting us into instrument groups to learn it; and b) showing us HOW to apply what we learned! We played a couple of parts of songs where we all got to try incorporating the lick. While we did learn one specific lick (well, 3 variations of the same lick), he also emphasize the overall idea of how/when to use licks. Just a great session.","Xpos","Xpos","I had only passing interaction with Leigh this year, and I missed seeing her more! We were in one late night jam together and the group was advanced enough to try new songs, and hard songs! As always, Leigh was so supportive.","","","I had only passing interaction with Dee this year. :-(","","","I did not have any interaction with Cecil; not even sure I could pick him out of a line up!","Pos","Pos","Julie was friendly, but clearly a novice at being a coach. She coached the Chick Keys a couple of times, and no real insights for us, just general positive ""sounds good!"" feedback.  In at least two sessions, she was busy chomping her gum and seemed preoccupied; if I didn't know better she could have been mistaken for one of the teen campers who sometimes seem bored with us old geezers!

In the third session where she coached us, Gilbert showed up and we asked him to stay to just play banjo (as our banjo player was not available - long story). Gilbert did a great job just being the banjo player and not stepping on Julie's toes, and deliberately would say ""I'm not the coach here, ask Julie!"" In this scenario, Julie was a bit more engaged with our group and was more proactive in giving us feedback (and the feedback seemed on point). Kudos to both Gilbert and Julie in this situation. ","","","Zeb? Never heard of the guy!","","","Brandon....sounds familiar but have no clue who this was.","","","I wasn't in any sessions with Liam but that would have been a treat!","Pos","Vpos","Pete gave our band some grief for spending time rehearsing instead of attending harmony singing. I get his point about deviating from the schedule, and we should have kept him informed. But it was the only opportunity to work with our ""hired gun"" banjo player. If we had known there was a special guest visiting during that time, we would have been happy to make a big effort to participate more in that session. He came down on us pretty hard.

But...then we got to have Pete coach our band later that day, and it was EXTREMELY helpful. Pete is so gifted as a teacher, and I've not had much time with him in previous camps. Lots of basic stuff, but also some nuanced instruction.

Overall, I am so grateful to Pete (and the rest) for his passion to spread the message about bluegrass and teaching people HOW to jam. It's changed my life. So while Pete can sometimes be a bit gruff, it's all still worth it. He's a quality guy, and gifted teacher, and his contributions to all of us adult learners is hard to calculate.

We're like family.","I'm impressed with how Pete takes the feedback seriously, and isn't afraid to change things from year to year.  Case in point:  eliminating the lengthy voting process for the two songs to do at Merlefest.  Here are some more:  the beginner bass class.  The dobro class.  The fiddle tune jam at 5:00.  ","The open mic and the jamboree, and especially the encouraging support from everyone there.  I love those evenings.

The application clearly asks for our jamming experience, and Pete knows those of us who return every year.  I'd like to see the groups put in place before we arrive.  Of course there will be last minute changes due to latecomers, but the  process could be significantly streamlined.  My group was one of the last chosen, and we didn't get to start jamming until 11:00.","Some of the groups had members, first-timers who had self-designated ""intermediate"" but had not taken Pete's guidelines/rules to heart.  They were not prepared to lead songs and some said they didn't want to sing.  A lot of time was wasted while they flipped through song books trying to find a song, and then had to figure out the key.  Some of the coaches, if present, didn't move to correct the situation.  Perhaps mention could be made in the general session that anyone in the jam group could step up, take a leadership position, and suggest moving to the next person in the circle while the the unprepared person comes up with a song he wants to lead the next time around.","I feel we got mixed signals about the harmony singing class.  I thought it was optional.  I think it's vitally important for anyone who hasn't taken it or has a desire to take it, but for those of us who feel secure in our harmony singing, I would like to feel comfortable choosing another option.","A chord class for fiddle players.

The entire program was exceptional but the unexpected surprise was playing live on stage at Merles fest...I had not really considered or envisioned that until we were on the bus headed to the stage.    That was a wonderful  and profound insight into the life of a performer, the bus ride to the backstage setting the mood and building excitement, waiting to go on stage and then playing in the rain to a huge crowd

I could see how a person could live for those moments and the exchange of energy.     As an introvert, I was happy to be a backrow backup and chorus player and I could imagine that those who took solos would be even more so elated by the experience.

I decided at camp that I was playing banjo for the wrong reasons and so I have switched to guitar and fortunate to have the guidance from the camp experience plus good friends and neighbors ( some from the camp) to work together and share music

Or maybe try groups of six?","The amazing kids are one of my favorite parts of camp, but I struggled this year with kids in my jam group and instrument classes. It might be a good idea to make sure there's an experienced coach in jam groups where a kid is jamming for the first time, to help explain the ground rules and observe how they're doing.
