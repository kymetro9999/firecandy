I think the singing is often the weakest link in the jam and many people feel insecure  when they are asked to sing anything   It is very difficult to get them to break through the stagefright</li><li>Better instrument for self evaluation of "bluegrass" skills and knowledge, first day I self assessed my self in the intermediate/advanced group as I have played music since I in 2nd grade and have played guitar for 50 years but found I have 0 "bluegrass" skills,   First day was pretty much lost on me as I needed to be in the basic group</li><li>Beak out instrumental  instruction by a couple of degrees of ability.  We had two coaches and novice to advanced campers in our mando class.</li><li>Wednesday felt like  a day of practice for the Jamboree.  In the afternoon I heard groups across the campus playing the same songs over and over.    I understand feeling nervous, stressed  and distracted about performing especially if one is a beginner and it is important to have time to prepare.    I missed the focus, direction, and  learning of the two previous  days - it almost seemed like camp was over Tuesday evening.</li><li>I felt that the focus for the  majority of the campers on Wednesday was practicing for the Jamboree and in many ways it was an all-day prep for the performance.  I understand the stress of performing and the need to practice.   I missed the focus and learning I experienced in the first two days.      I don't know that there is anything that can be done to change the vibe for the day - the performance is fun and a learning opportunity - I  wanted to be honest about how I experienced the day.  </li><li>The only thing I see to improve is myself, the camp offered so much more than I could engage in and so  I will work to improve by playing music with others and be ready next year  </li><li>it was great, no need to change it</li><li>A little more instrument  instruction</li><li>I would not like to be in a group with talented your folks under 18 yrs. old.</li><li>80 campers might have been a little too many - 60 or so  might be a better number
</li><li>Better communication of upcoming schedule and what to except from one day to the next. </li><li>More flexibility for students to chose electives</li><li>More clear description of the Dr. Banjo teaching method.   As a former instructional evaluator, I was trying to connect the dots between a clearly stated learning objectives, presentation methods and evaluation of outcomes</li><li>Start promptly at 9:00 with the daily instructions/plans and finish in 30 minutes.</li><li>camp was great</li><li>The camp was very large and there were a few times locations, what's next, etc. was confusing</li><li>Large jam groups</li><li>more instructor led slow jams</li><li>More time to jam and less emphasis on preparing to perform for an audience </li><li>Flexible (optional) late afternoon schedule. Long day for some.</li><li>Logistics for group jams and small groups was sometimes difficult, I understand and appreciate how difficult it is to do.  </li><li>Don't get any bigger in terms of the number of campers.</li><li>I thought it was very well executed</li><li>Nothing else</li></ul></div><div><h3>Add or emphasize</h3><ul><li>You said this but for many closet players like  me  the approach has been wrong  we buy a book memorize the tab of one song after another and when we get in a group cant keep up or our memorized thing doesnt fit in . you have to learn to keep up then play the tune then add the licks on the spot by ear. a different method </li><li>Each of the sessions should have some type of stated learning objective, what we are going to do, instructor/coach expectations and what I can do to optimize my participation.</li><li>I really enjoyed the improvisation that was always around with the schedule and plans...was great to see how musicians handle bureaucracy....was inspiring and I thought it was entertaining as there was also a great sense of humor and just the joy of having fun </li><li>the balance was fine</li><li>Individual instrument focus</li><li>How to learn a melody of a song.  </li><li>add harmony singing to the jam camp jamboree (maybe with instructors participating with us) </li></ul></div><div><h3>Subtract or de-emphasize</h3><ul><li>less food I gained 5 pounds</li><li>Jamming in the first day, particularly for first time campers,</li><li>Less rain...maybe...but playing live at Merlefest in the rain is such a great memory</li><li>Don't know</li><li>singing lessons</li><li>can't think of anything</li><li>Performing for an audience </li></ul></div><div><h3>Improving pre-class materials</h3><ul><li>For first timers, maybe a short list of the songs that were sang a lot while there. Moreover, to learn lyrics.</li><li>list the tunes you are going to cover in the camp.  you sent the msot popular tunes  then jammed with  different tunes</li><li>The mandolin attachment with former student comments was formatted with different fonts and seemed pretty quickly thrown together.</li><li>Better description of the 4 day course design, suggested learning activities to help me better prepare for the different classes.</li><li>I see no way to improve on it</li><li>There was a lot of information to sort through and the materials did not provide me with what was most important for me to focus on prior to arrival.  A simple checklist would be very helpful with the back up materials then provided. For example, as a first time jam camper I did not know I would need to sing solos and be prepared to lead a jam. A checklist item that says be prepared with X number of memorized songs, then the back up materials could provide the list of possibilities.</li><li>might send YouTube links of standard BG songs </li><li>Add a schedule of what to expect each day - when the day begins and ends, what happens in the morning, afternoon and evening. Understanding that this is tentative but at least providing an outline of what to expect. </li></ul></div><div><h3>Food</h3><ul><li>Very good.</li><li>Food was great. </li><li>good I gained 5 pounds</li><li>Food was totally fine, maybe a little better than I expected...</li><li>3 on a scale of ten, consistently mediocre </li><li>Not typically what I would eat, but they did about as good a job as possible given the number of folks to feed.</li><li>food was great,,,,fresh and delicious with wide variety</li><li>Appreciated healthy items on the menu.     Staff very helpful. </li><li>The food was good and met my expectations for a YMCA type camp. It was always timely and had a good variety over the 4 days.</li><li>Delicious! very good.</li><li>very good as usual</li><li>Excellent </li></ul></div><hr /><table><tr><th></th><th>Excellent</th><th>Very good</th><th>Adequate</th><th>Sub-par</th></tr><tr><tr><td>Tuesday afternoon improvisation</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr></tr><tr><tr><td>Tuesday afternoon music Theory</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr></tr><tr><tr><td>Tuesday afternoon history</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>0</td></tr></tr></table><hr /><table><tr><th></th><th>Excellent</th><th>Very good</th><th>Adequate</th><th>Sub-par</th></tr><tr><tr><td>Tuesday open mic</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>0</td></tr></tr><tr><tr><td>Wednesday jamboree</td><td>10</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr></tr><tr><tr><td>Thursday cabin stage</td><td>11</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></tr><tr><tr><td>Fiddle tunes jam</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr></tr></table><div><h3>First heard about class</h3><ul><li>Email announcement:  (0)</li><li>Merlefest website:  (6)</li><li>DrBanjo.com or bgJAM.com:  (0)</li><li>MandolinCafe.com:  (0)</li><li>BanjoHangout.com:  (0)</li><li>Other website:  (0)</li><li>Fiddler magazine:  (0)</li><li>Flatpicking Guitar magazine:  (0)</li><li>Other magazine:  (1)</li><li>Teacher:  (0)</li><li>Saw Cabin Stage performance or workshop at Merlefest:  (1)</li><li>Wilkes Acoustic Folk Society:  (1)</li><li>From a previous camper:  (3)</li><li>Other:  (2)</li></ul></div><div><h3>Comments--first heard about class</h3><ul><li>Past year.</li><li>bluegrass unlimited ad</li><li>I will be back next year!</li><li>Herb Key</li><li>Saw the camp perform at Bristol last year</li><li>have attended many previous jamcamps  so we knew about this. </li></ul></div><div><h3>To tell the WM office</h3><ul><li>Thought the camp was very good.

</li><li>Thank you Pete and Joan. Your class bumped me up another level musically and looking forward to next year. </li><li>thanks for taking me at the last minute   Wesley Lawton MD</li><li>Job well done!</li><li>May want to limit the camp size next year and require newbies like me to the bluegrass method to buy or include your bluegrass slow jam for beginners for the price of admission.</li><li>You have a terrific method and run a fabulously fun camp!</li><li>Thanks for such a grand experience and for helping me to find a better path to playing music....I found that all the TAB i learned was not so directly useful to me

The entire program was exceptional but the unexpected surprise was playing live on stage at Merles fest...I had not really considered or envisioned that until we were on the bus headed to the stage.    That was a wonderful  and profound insight into the life of a performer, the bus ride to the backstage setting the mood and building excitement, waiting to go on stage and then playing in the rain to a huge crowd

I could see how a person could live for those moments and the exchange of energy.     As an introvert, I was happy to be a backrow backup and chorus player and I could imagine that those who took solos would be even more so elated by the experience.

I decided at camp that I was playing banjo for the wrong reasons and so I have switched to guitar and fortunate to have the guidance from the camp experience plus good friends and neighbors ( some from the camp) to work together and share music

Thanks for being an inspiration and for all the guidance and help

G</li><li>I'm seeing the Wernick method being taught in more places around the country. A number of sessions are listed in the Bluegrass Today events calendar. It seems to be expanding nicely and helping to promote bluegrass jamming to a growing audience who might not have tried it otherwise. I think the bluegrass festivals can be a great source of new students. Thanks for what you are doing!</li><li>Tell Pete and Joan thanks for another great camp!  Hope to see them next year.  Our 7-year old son might be ready to join us by then.
Our other sons, Walt and Noah, would love to have a Henderson guitar and mandolin if Pete can get them moved up on his "list"!

Thanks.

I was not aware of the "open mic" night Tuesday night and the Wednesday night performance in advance, please make them more clear in the literature, I regret not being able to participate in them.
This was a great experience for me and offer these comments with a sincere desire to help improve an already great process.  Thank you </li></ul></div><div><hr /><h3>Scott Freeman</h3><table><tr><th></th><th>Xpos</th><th>Vpos</th><th>Pos</th><th>Neg</th><th>VNeg</th></tr><tr><tr><td>Fun</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></tr><tr><tr><td>Results</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></tr></table><div><h3></h3><ul></ul></div><div><h3></h3><ul><li>Scott is a wonderful teacher!
