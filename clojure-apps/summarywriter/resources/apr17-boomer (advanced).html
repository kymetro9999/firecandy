Also the white board with group assignments was very efficient and saved time.  </li></ul></div><div><h3>Things to change</h3><ul><li>More Instructor coaching of band skills and stagecraft</li><li>Seems like this camp is fine tuned into a well oiled machine.  Not much needs to be changed</li><li>Make band group performance Tue and fun open mike jamboree last night</li><li>We only had a coach for half of the jams.  I missed the interaction and getting to know the other teachers.</li><li>More in depth instrument classes.</li><li>I can't really think of any significant changes. I'm happy with it the way it is.</li><li>A little more organization which would provide more time for jamming</li><li>Availability of coaches during jam groups</li><li>The tedious selection process for selecting jam groups on Monday morning.  The application clearly asks for our jamming experience, and Pete knows those of us who return every year.  I'd like to see the groups put in place before we arrive.  Of course there will be last minute changes due to latecomers, but the  process could be significantly streamlined.  My group was one of the last chosen, and we didn't get to start jamming until 11:00.</li><li>Spending less time on organization matters, or being better organized for those necessary items</li><li>More time jamming together</li><li>add a day would be nice</li><li>With 80 attendees there needs to be more pre-planning for jam groups.  There was a LOT of time spent on dividing attendees into the small jam groups, which felt unorganized and used a lot of time on the first day.  I know the task can be monumental, but it seems that most campers are returnees, thus there should be some knowledge of their skill levels.  Perhaps more specific questions could be added to the sign up sheet to help with that process.</li><li>Be more concise.   Too much talk in morning general sessions.</li><li>making sure that all groups have a coach every session, our group did not</li><li>Switching up of jam groups.  My group was somewhat slow paced and it would have been great to pick with other people.</li><li>I would work in the costs of 3 meals a day into the camp tuition.</li><li>Less rain</li><li>Have someone whose specific job it was to organise and facilitate (eg the organisation of the small groups) so that Pete could be more free to teach and oversee. A few times there was confusion over who was in what group and it felt like that took time out of the actual sessions</li><li>Make the harmony singing workshop elective, and keep it that way.  Don't expect campers to be there if they already know how to harmonize, and don't get upset when it is not well attended.</li><li>Increase quantity and quality of instructors OR lower the limit on number of participants</li><li>Tell folks to keep it clean, no cursing </li><li>More organization of the jam groups. I had 2 jam group sessions this year that did not have a coach show up.</li><li>More class options</li><li>Skill level could be better organized by band </li><li> consider jam groups based on 1) knowledge of more than 10 songs, 2) knowledge of 5 songs, 3) no knowledge of songs - and have a coach</li><li>Change the jam groups up a bit</li><li>I really can't think of anything.  It was remarkably  well-organized  given the number of campers.  </li><li>Improve the sound system.</li><li>Since it was my first time at jam camp, I don't know if I would change anything at this point.  I found myself learning on all levels, so how do you improve that.</li><li>More Music less talking in jam sessions</li><li>put all  participants in new jam groups each day.   do not let groups jam only with the same people,  keep mixing the people.</li><li>Repertoire reviews and enhancement</li><li>I'm a planner and would like to have know what to expect for the daily schedule.  I get great enjoyment in planning before events.  I'll know next time.</li><li>Being able to pick who you wan to be with.</li><li>N/A</li><li>Their was a big difference between the "new" teachers and the teachers that are normally there</li><li>Get to play with more different groups</li><li>Some of the groups had members, first-timers who had self-designated "intermediate" but had not taken Pete's guidelines/rules to heart.  They were not prepared to lead songs and some said they didn't want to sing.  A lot of time was wasted while they flipped through song books trying to find a song, and then had to figure out the key.  Some of the coaches, if present, didn't move to correct the situation.  Perhaps mention could be made in the general session that anyone in the jam group could step up, take a leadership position, and suggest moving to the next person in the circle while the the unprepared person comes up with a song he wants to lead the next time around.</li><li>Do one song repetitively and improving on it each time. Do this at least once at the camp</li><li>Working on ONE song and doing it really well. This would be only one part of the teaching experience</li><li>better instrument classes ( seemed kind of random - no handouts or much specific)</li><li>80 attendees is huge for this camp. Consider a lower maximum...</li><li>Maybe play more group songs in the morning all together session, that is fun to me, not just the two that will be performed on the cabin stage</li><li>It would be nice if the part of the jams or class focus included a few fiddle tunes for those of us that enjoy fiddle tunes.</li><li>Add an evening for the instructors to perform.</li><li>More Bacon!</li><li>For the coaches to have more of a directional and instructional remit when we're jamming. A few times it felt like they were just there to sit in and keep things moving, which was fine but sometimes would have appreciated more tips and advice on how we could sound better as a group</li><li>Have dessert at lunch!</li><li>More involvement in coaching the jams</li><li>More patience with beginners</li><li>Consider the coaches using the walkie- talkies that camp Harrison provides to stay in better touch.</li><li>Longer instrument class time</li><li>Extend jam time to 1 2/2 hours in the morning and the same in the afternoon</li><li>na </li><li>Separate after- hours slow  jam.</li><li>Would like to learn more jam etiquette </li><li>More instructors jamming with low level jammers in the evenings.   Gilbert and Keith did jam with lower ability levels.
These people need the time in good jams and sometimes they felt left behind in the evenings.</li><li>Assign Joan to me as permanent coach. </li><li>Switching instruments.</li><li>N/A</li><li>Some teachers had structure in the jam groups and the others did not. The structure helped our group.</li><li>I feel we got mixed signals about the harmony singing class.  I thought it was optional.  I think it's vitally important for anyone who hasn't taken it or has a desire to take it, but for those of us who feel secure in our harmony singing, I would like to feel comfortable choosing another option.</li><li>Less time on organizational details and more time discussing musicianship and performance</li><li>a little more time for jamming if possible</li><li>Seemed to be a great emphasis on performances over the last couple of days.  Maybe just have open mics on Tuesday and Wednesday instead of a "required" jam group performance.</li><li>A class on finding and picking out the melody of vocal songs on your instrument.</li><li>Offer some T-shirts for sale</li><li>Option to stay over thursday night</li><li>More dedicated "slow jams" so all can participate</li><li>better food </li><li>na</li><li>Make sure every camper has at least 3 jam songs; and put together a comprehensive list of the songs, by camper.</li><li>Mix ages more in jam bands </li><li>Some groups worked on their performance songs in all the sessions.   Some members of those groups were quite frustrated with the only one focus for the week.</li></ul></div><div><h3>Add or emphasize</h3><ul><li>Afternoon naps</li><li>Back up playing, keeping rhythm behind the singer or soloist.   </li><li>Jams with the coaches.</li><li>Emphasize who should be in the advanced instrument classes and who shouldn't. Also when we jam, it shouldn't be all about the songs you can sing. We should add more instrumentals in the camp. It's a lot more fun to jam that way then just singing the same tune songs over an over.</li><li>None</li><li>Learning to solo / take break </li><li>A chord class for fiddle players.  We had some good players, but some had trouble leading songs because they didn't know the chords to the songs they wanted to sing, or they just wanted to do fiddle tunes and couldn't describe them to those who didn't know them.</li><li>The mind set that you need to create to be on stage.
On You Tube, I looked up stage performance and TED talks and found much valuable incite.  I think the novices would benefit especially from that. I think Pete has done that in the past.</li><li>More performance discussion. Maybe more anecdotes from the experienced performers, The TED talks go into this on YouTube.  I would like to hear about Pete and Joan's performance and musical experience.</li><li>As I mentioned, a little more time for jamming - maybe the instrument classes could be a little shorter and more focused</li><li>Maybe mix up the jam groups a little more frequently.  I understand this can be a difficult task.</li><li>Would not change, think it is a good mix</li><li>Ear training for melody lines.</li><li>No change. Everything was well-balanced</li><li>The electives were all so interesting it would be nice to be able to go to more than one over the course of the camp. Definitely would have liked more on improvisation, the session with Keith was great</li><li>Level-appropriate instrument instruction.  Maybe split large instrument instruction groups into two groups based on level?</li><li>jam coaching</li><li>Folks need more room on cabin stage or to spread out; but probably not possible.</li><li>The harmony instruction this year did not feel quite so organized as prior years.  Consider having 3 coaches teach the harmony class instead of just Pete doing all three parts. Then the coaches could each take a part and show how it is done.</li><li>I think a longer time in instrument class, or at least that option, would be great</li><li>Kieth yoder is the best teacher I've ever met</li><li>I liked the emphasis on jamming. </li><li>More work on finding the melody, and then building a break around the melody.
More optional choice activities.</li><li>I really enjoyed and got more out of learning how to solo.</li><li>History sessions possibly in the evenings.  Bluegrass has a very interesting history related to the culture.  People can feel part of the culture if they learn some of the culture.   Pete is great at the history and I missed that part. </li></ul></div><div><h3>Subtract or de-emphasize</h3><ul><li>Less talk more music</li><li>nothing,  seems like the right mix is there.</li><li>So much singing. Not everyone is a fan.</li><li>None.....I experienced an absence of frustrations this year.</li><li>Less time in the morning announcements</li><li>The housekeeping aspects.  I could listen to Pete talk all day about bluegrass history, personalities, the music...  perhaps someone the other things might be edited.</li><li>Do Not Know</li><li>Less organizational time spent with the class.</li><li>I mentioned a little less time on instrument classes</li><li>Less emphasis on performances</li><li>same as above</li><li>The songs/rehearsal for the cabin stage performance.</li><li>Nothing to add here.</li><li>Felt like we spent a lot of time harmony singing in the afternoons but maybe that's because it was often the same song. </li><li>Harmony singing as a stand-alone class.  Maybe offer it as an elective.</li><li>Stage performances</li><li>nothing</li><li>Possibility for another class during harmony class. </li><li>na</li><li>Nothing sticks out.</li><li>Nothing</li><li>Getting ready for the Wednesday night jamming groups.  Some worked only other performance songs for three days.  Had e band scramble at 6:00 and start to perform at 7:00 on Wednesday.</li></ul></div><div><h3>Improving pre-class materials</h3><ul><li>More basic song lyrics in a pocket size booklet form</li><li>It's just fine.</li><li>Pre select MERLEFEST songs email before camp so novice campers can feel more prepared and already know the words and melody</li><li>good as is.  Thanks.</li><li>Need more stuff to explain about the camp.</li><li>As a veteran camper, I don't usually get these materials any more, so I can't really comment on this.</li><li>I addressed this earlier.  People are told to come prepared to lead songs.  Doesn't necessarily happen.  Fines, perhaps?  (Just kidding)</li><li>Don't know.</li><li>?Don't know.</li><li>No changes needed here.  Good info included in all communications.</li><li>Maybe people's email addresses shared before?</li><li>No issue here</li><li>Possibly just more on the admin of the camp and what to expect. Maybe some song lyrics for songs we're going to sing? The musical materials were great. </li><li>They were fine.</li><li>No, I thought that as usual, pre camp materials were great</li><li>I dont think there needs to be improvement there </li><li>na</li><li>They were fine.   Liked the pre-camp distribution. </li><li>Emphasize having 3 songs to jam.</li><li>N/A</li><li>Encourage new jammers pick out melodies on their instrument by trial and error before they arrive and learn chords to fit them.</li></ul></div><div><h3>Food</h3><ul><li>It was OK. </li><li>Great.</li><li>It was good and plentiful</li><li>Lots of scrambled eggs this year.  It was all pretty good though and better then Steve Kaufman's Camp food.  His is legendary as being the worst.</li><li>O.k. </li><li>Excellent!</li><li>Very good!</li><li>I thought it was adequate to good.....perhaps not quite as imaginative as in the past years, and certainly not as much fun as when we had those 3 local mountain ladies
in charge, but no complaints.</li><li>Very good for the number of people they were serving!!</li><li>Very good </li><li>Better than before!</li><li>Mighty fine</li><li>Not so good. Too much meat, limited salad bar, little vegetarian choices. Breakfast very limited. Not really healthy choices as has been in the past.</li><li>Fine - as long as there is a salad bar I am covered regardless of the entree and there was so I was fine</li><li>I'm sure it's wonderful, but a little to "health conscious" for my tastes.</li><li>OK.    </li><li>Thought it was good;  maybe less variety than last year.</li><li>The food was great.</li><li>Good</li><li>Very good and plentiful</li><li>Incredible </li><li>It was very good, overall.  Good quality and selection.  I never went hungry!</li><li>No complaints</li><li>very good. maybe a notch down from years past</li><li>OK </li><li>Slightly off this year compared to prior years but still great. No major complaints.</li><li>Great!</li><li>Very good</li><li>The cafeteria does a great job! </li><li>it's always really good</li><li>great</li><li>Any time food appears in front of me and I had nothing to do with it, I'm thrilled!</li><li>Good variety and quality.</li><li>I thought the food was great!</li><li>Really good</li><li>Very adequate and certainly enough.  Salads were very good.  Beverages are the best.  desserts were too good. </li></ul></div><hr /><table><tr><th></th><th>Excellent</th><th>Very good</th><th>Adequate</th><th>Sub-par</th></tr><tr><tr><td>Tuesday afternoon improvisation</td><td>13</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr></tr><tr><tr><td>Tuesday afternoon music Theory</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr></tr><tr><tr><td>Tuesday afternoon history</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr></tr></table><hr /><table><tr><th></th><th>Excellent</th><th>Very good</th><th>Adequate</th><th>Sub-par</th></tr><tr><tr><td>Tuesday open mic</td><td>17</td><td>11</td><td>11</td><td>0</td></tr></tr><tr><tr><td>Wednesday jamboree</td><td>26</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>0</td></tr></tr><tr><tr><td>Thursday cabin stage</td><td>20</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>0</td></tr></tr><tr><tr><td>Fiddle tunes jam</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr></tr></table><div><h3>First heard about class</h3><ul><li>Email announcement:  (1)</li><li>Merlefest website:  (3)</li><li>DrBanjo.com or bgJAM.com:  (6)</li><li>MandolinCafe.com:  (0)</li><li>BanjoHangout.com:  (0)</li><li>Other website:  (0)</li><li>Fiddler magazine:  (0)</li><li>Flatpicking Guitar magazine:  (1)</li><li>Other magazine:  (0)</li><li>Teacher:  (1)</li><li>Saw Cabin Stage performance or workshop at Merlefest:  (4)</li><li>Wilkes Acoustic Folk Society:  (3)</li><li>From a previous camper:  (15)</li><li>Other:  (1)</li></ul></div><div><h3>Comments--first heard about class</h3><ul><li>Even though this was the largest group ever, I thought this was one of the best camps ever, with a great group of people and a large and interesting staff of coaches that we really enjoyed. While we may have been almost rained off the Cabin Stage this year, it came off very well, in my opinion, and I received quite a number of positive comments from those who saw this year's performance. Although not everyone may agree, I rather liked having Pete choose the two songs we performed as it bypassed all the
frustration of having to vote and experience disappointments.</li><li>Don't remember, but seeing you on the Cabin Stage probably had something to do with it.</li><li>I will be back next year.  I look forward to next years camp from May till next April
Wish the camp in Boomer was twice a year.
THANK YOU</li><li>John Bishop</li><li>We heard about the camp from Liam and William Purcell.</li><li>I saw a flyer in the Artists tent at Merlefest many years ago, and always wanted to attend.  </li><li>Flyer in 2000</li><li>My nephew from. Boone attended Jam Camp last year and thought that I would like it, so he talked me into it.  Most fun I've had in years!</li><li>Jam class at Merlefest by Pete in 2000</li></ul></div><div><h3>To tell the WM office</h3><ul><li>I appreciated how much Pete was willing to accommodate the more senior attendees. Allowing us to form our own groups made it fun for us and ensured no one was held back by level differences. We had a great time. </li><li>Great program and great teachers.  Thanks.</li><li>No</li><li>Nothing but my sincere thanks for providing this interesting and exciting opportunity allowing folks to get more involved in bluegrass....it's one thing to enjoy and appreciate bluegrass music, but quite another to feel comfortable in actually participating in it on a performance level.</li><li>This is my third year, and having 80 people felt like too many compared to 70-ish in past years.

I appreciate all the hard work that Pete puts into the camp and into ensuring we all have a positive experience.

Instructors are great, for the most part! Can you get Bob Menke and Alan Epstein for next year? They are great.</li><li>I truly admire Pete's dedication and  devotion to the cause.  He changed my life.</li><li>Pete,
Thank you so much for the confidence you have shown in letting me perform my little verse on stage. I know you were worried that I would screw it up.
I will tell you that I wanted to get it right to a large degree because of your desire for ME to get it right and to pull off a successful performance. I felt the power of your personality and musicianship behind me and so,  I think, did just fine .  I fully realize the support and good wishes of all the other jam mates and benefited from them.
Thank You.  See you next year if not sooner.                       Lou,    Your student and friend.
</li><li>Don't retire yet!!  Keep doing it!!!</li><li>Overall it was a great experience and I am already looking forward to next year's camp.</li><li>I thoroughly enjoyed camp this year.  It brings together a great staff, quality instruction, and chances for jamming and building friendships.  I will certainly be back, as many seem to do!</li><li>Best week of the year, every year - keep up the good work!</li><li>Lots of returning jammers each year raise the level of the camp. However, in some ways it detracts from the learning.  I felt the classes were geared either novice or advanced.
Being a intermediate player, I felt a little lost in the open jams because they always gravitated to the highest common denominator.

Somehow it is always hard to get people to  break up a 20 person jam into smaller groups.

A few  times our jamming group was without an instructor.</li><li>Excellent camp, please keep it going. </li><li>Another great year. Overall, I think the large size of camp seemed to be stressing the coaches. You might have found the limit to expansion. Seemed to function a little better in the past at a slightly smaller overall size.  I also heard the coaches privately complaining about disorganization this year - something I have never heard before.  I think using the walkie talkies might help so the coaches can stay in touch - if it could be done in a non disruptive way.</li><li>There were a few situations in which some of the younger girls were made to feel uncomfortable (socially) by one of the non-campers. I feel like the young people, especially the younger girls, would benefit from hearing/understanding that they can approach any coach or adult to discuss any situation in which they feel uncomfortable, with the knowledge that it will be well received. </li><li>I had a really great time and I learned a lot.  Thank you for allowing me to attend this year!</li><li>Keep it up</li><li>RB and I have been to more jam camps than Pete!   This one, as far as I'm concerned, ran the smoothest of all.  Good work, Everybody!</li><li>Pete: Thanks for your continued encouragement. Thanks largely to you, I am seeing significant progress in my playing.</li><li>I had a great time after being apprehensive about it I'm glad I attended.

We missed Chris and Rick Saenz this year</li></ul></div><div><h3>Other comments</h3><ul><li>The "Jam Coaching" was rated as average because we only had a coach for half the jams.  The coaches we did have were great each time.  </li><li>No</li><li>Keith Yoder is a gem.  I didn't have him as a coach this year, but his enthusiasm, disposition, and willingness to help anybody who needs help is a great asset.  And his improv class is the best. </li><li>Jan Camp at Boomer , what I look forward to all year.</li><li>Thanks for a wonderful experience!</li><li>Overall Wernick Jam camps are the BEST. I appreciate the fact that Pete is listening and open to suggestions and is totally willing to make changes.</li><li>I thoroughly enjoy camp and look so forward to it every year!</li><li>I was frustrated this year the first day of my jam group when no one knew any songs! Peter does a great job sending out information ahead of time and a list of songs we should learn. It was frustrating to go around the circle and people would take 10 minutes to search for a song to sing in a book. That's why I think it might be a good idea to group the jams according to 1) lots of songs, 2) some songs and 3) first timers,

Love the camp! Overall, it was a fun and worthwhile experience! </li><li>Some of the new instructors didn't appear well versed in Pete's jamming protocols, (tick-tick-tock-tock, etc.)</li><li>I wish I had attended sooner.</li><li>Bridget Allen's email is bmallen70@gmail.com</li></ul></div><div><hr /><h3>Scott Freeman</h3><table><tr><th></th><th>Xpos</th><th>Vpos</th><th>Pos</th><th>Neg</th><th>VNeg</th></tr><tr><tr><td>Fun</td><td>29</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></tr><tr><tr><td>Results</td><td>26</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></tr></table><div><h3></h3><ul></ul></div><div><h3></h3><ul><li>Scott is one of the best instructors I've ever had.

I was brand new to the instrument, and there were intermediate and advanced folks also in the same group, and I think we all got something out of it.

A wealth of knowledge.</li><li>Pete is the consummate pro at this and really knows what he's doing. He gets results. He can be a bit acerbic at times, but all in a good cause! We all owe him a lot for creating these camps which are so great at getting closet pickers out of that closet.</li><li>Pete gave our band some grief for spending time rehearsing instead of attending harmony singing. I get his point about deviating from the schedule, and we should have kept him informed. But it was the only opportunity to work with our "hired gun" banjo player. If we had known there was a special guest visiting during that time, we would have been happy to make a big effort to participate more in that session. He came down on us pretty hard.

But...then we got to have Pete coach our band later that day, and it was EXTREMELY helpful. Pete is so gifted as a teacher, and I've not had much time with him in previous camps. Lots of basic stuff, but also some nuanced instruction.

Overall, I am so grateful to Pete (and the rest) for his passion to spread the message about bluegrass and teaching people HOW to jam. It's changed my life. So while Pete can sometimes be a bit gruff, it's all still worth it. He's a quality guy, and gifted teacher, and his contributions to all of us adult learners is hard to calculate. </li><li>Always a joy.

However, one size does not fit all, and he tends to apply pressure where it may not be needed. </li><li>Great example, and great teacher. </li><li>What can I say? Remains the best, and the reason I return.</li><li>Pete is a wealth of knowledge!</li><li>As many times as I have heard Pete talk, I ALWAYS pick up new things to incorporate into my playing and singing. This year's harmony workshop helped me understand yet another nuance of harmony that I had not understood in previous harmony workshops at camp.</li><li>Need to develop some new jokes. Missed some of the history of bluegrass.</li><li>I like the fact that Pete has a great deal of patience and thinks that everyone can sing.</li><li>Very encouraging </li><li>Pete is strong at encouraging new jammers to do it right.

</li><li>Julie was friendly, but clearly a novice at being a coach. She coached the Chick Keys a couple of times, and no real insights for us, just general positive "sounds good!" feedback.  In at least two sessions, she was busy chomping her gum and seemed preoccupied; if I didn't know better she could have been mistaken for one of the teen campers who sometimes seem bored with us old geezers!

In the third session where she coached us, Gilbert showed up and we asked him to stay to just play banjo (as our banjo player was not available - long story). Gilbert did a great job just being the banjo player and not stepping on Julie's toes, and deliberately would say "I'm not the coach here, ask Julie!" In this scenario, Julie was a bit more engaged with our group and was more proactive in giving us feedback (and the feedback seemed on point). Kudos to both Gilbert and Julie in this situation. </li><li>A gem!  I enjoyed very much her leading or coaching our jam group.  I think will be an excellent teacher.
