## Welcome to my corner of GitHub!

This repo has a number of small oddball projects in it. I am at the stage of learning to code that I tend to write many small things, and this is an easy way to keep track of them.

Most of the code here is either Clojure, Clojurescript, or E-lisp. I will be branching out eventually.

In case you're wondering, 'firecandy' is meaningless, I picked it to be short and memorable.
